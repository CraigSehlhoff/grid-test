HEY!
Thank you for taking the time to check out my game and checking out my README! I made this game for the React Game Jam for the fall of 2024.

It might be obvious but this is my first attempt at making a game. I have been learning to code for under a year and have only been working with React for about a month now. The day before the game jam started was the first time I was able to make a block move on an empty screen with different inputs and just that basic movement turned into this!

I have learned more about coding in this last week than I have in the last 6 months all because of this game jam! I am so excited for the next one so I can show off everything I will be able to do by then!

I would appreciate ANY and all feedback. You can find me on discord and twitter as VirtualSobriety or even shoot me an email at myvirtualsobriety@gmail.com.

This is my offical description if the game
"It's a retro styled grid based maze runner. Inspired by NES era games and early flash games. You move around a grid and collect coins in levels/worlds that get perpetually more challenging as you go. Can you collect all the coins and escape before you run out of steps?  
I did receive some help with troubleshooting from Chat GPT. Whenever Google searches failed this helped me with questions and concepts I was unfamiliar with in regards to React and game dev.
This is the first game I have ever made."
