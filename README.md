HEY!
Thank you for taking the time to check out my game and checking out my README! I made this game for the React Game Jam for the fall of 2024.

It might be obvious but this is my first attempt at making a game. I have been learning to code for under a year and have only been working with React for about a month now. The day before the game jam started was the first time I was able to make a block move on an empty screen with different inputs and just that basic movement turned into this!

I have learned more about coding in this last week than I have in the last 6 months all because of this game jam! I am so excited for the next one so I can show off everything I will be able to do by then!

I would appreciate ANY and all feedback. You can find me on discord and twitter as VirtualSobriety or even shoot me an email at myvirtualsobriety@gmail.com.
